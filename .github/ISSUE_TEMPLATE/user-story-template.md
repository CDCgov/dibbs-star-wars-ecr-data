## 👤💭 User Story

<!--
As a [user/persona], I want to [do a thing], so that I can [achieve a goal/outcome]
-->

## 🏗️ Acceptance Criteria

<!--
List out all expected functionality/requirements

Example using Given-When-Then:
- **Given** describes the initial context or state of the system (preconditions)
- **When** specifies the action or trigger that occurs
- **Then** defines the expected outcome or result
-->

- **Given**
- **When**
- **Then**

## 🎬 Scenarios

<!--
Write out scenarios that will help to ensure the functionality works as expected

For example, this could look like:
- I click on the Score filter and a dropdown appears showing a slider.
- “1” and “10” are selected by default. The submit button is disabled.
- I then drag the left slider to “6” making the score 6 to 10.
- The text input below updates to display “6” and submit button is now active.
- I click submit and the dropdown closes.
- My search results are now updated.
